			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<p>
				We need to understand how <span class="green">production</span> systems
				are doing their <span class="blue">job</span>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1><span class="green">Metrics</span></h1>
			<ul>
				<li>the use or study of poetic meters; prosody</li>
				<li>a method of measuring something, or the results obtained from this</li>

			<ul>
				<li class="gray">the use or study of poetic meters; prosody</li>
				<li class="green">a method of measuring something, or the results obtained from this</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Where do I start?</h1>
			<p>
				Any <span class="red">finite</span> resource you're using.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1><span class="green">What?</span></h1>
			<ul>
				<li>CPU time</li>
				<li>File system handles</li>
				<li>Memory usage</li>
				<li>File system usage</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<p>
				These metrics provide you with a <span class="orange">glimpse</span> of what is going
				on with the system in general and allows for noticing <span class="green">differences</span>
				in different hosts running the <span class="red">same</span> application.
			</p>

				<li>
					Operation <span class="orange">count</span>

					Response <span class="red">time</span>

				<li>
					<span class="blue">Correctness</span>, did we get the right data back?
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Got some <span class="orange">extra</span> time?</h1>
			<p>
				Same metrics mentioned before but for all the subsystems you have:
				<span class="green">database</span>, <span class="blue">caches</span> (add cache hit ratio here), <span
					class="red">file system access</span>,
				<span class="orange">other applications</span> being called.
			</p>

		<section>
			<h1>The case <span class="red">against</span> averages</h1>
			<p>
				Six users load your site in <span class="orange">0.1 second</span>,
				4 load it in <span class="blue">2 seconds</span>, average is <span class="yellow">0.86</span>.

		<section>
			<h1>Averages are <span class="red">bad</span> at detecting <span class="blue">outliers</span></h1>
			<p>
				They might show you a pretty number when <span class="orange">50% of your customers</span>
				are having an awful experience.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Still, percentiles are <span class="orange">hard</span></h1>
			<p>
				Specially at the beginning, don't be too harsh on you, pick a collection of percentiles
				that make sense <span class="green">(0.90, 0.95 and 0.99, for instance)</span> and remember that every
				9 you add after 0.99 is going to be <span class="blue">exponentially</span> more expensive than before.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Don't assume your metrics are the <span class="blue">be all and end all</span></h1>
			<p>
				Nice, your app has metrics and they're <span class="green">looking good</span>, but customers are still
				complaining and saying that the metrics you're showing <span
					class="red">don't match what they see</span>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Collect metrics at the <span class="yellow">customer</span></h1>
			<p>
				This doesn't mean you <span class="red">shouldn't collect</span> them at your app, but that you must
				also collect them at the customer's side so you can <span class="blue">compare</span>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1><span class="red">Can't</span> do it?</h1>
			<p>
				Create <span class="green">test apps</span> that call your service trying to <span class="yellow">replicate</span>
				your customer´s environments as much as possible and use that instead.
			</p>

				Each one of your main metrics is a <span class="orange">Service Level Indicator</span>. Collect them and
				build a <span class="blue">Service Level Objective</span>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Objective!</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="blue">53% of visits</span> are likely to be <span class="red">abandoned</span> if pages
				take longer than <span class="orange">3 seconds</span> to load.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>But don't be too <span class="red">aggressive</span></h1>
			<p>Setting an objective that's at the <span class="green">limit</span> of today's metrics might produce a
				huge amount of toil to
				maintain.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Example!</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>0.90 under <span class="green">500ms</span></li>
				<li>0.95 under <span class="orange">1 second</span></li>
				<li>0.99 under <span class="red">2 seconds</span></li>

				<li>Places to look for <span class="orange">more information</span></li>
				<li>Possible or other <span class="blue">known culprits</span></li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Alerts need a <span class="green">follow up</span></h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Was the alert <span class="red">useful</span>?</li>
				<li>Can we <span class="yellow">automate</span> the response?</li>
				<li>Is there <span class="orange">another metric</span> we could track to fine tune the alert?</li>
				<li>Can we prevent his alert from triggering again under the same <span
						class="blue">circumstances</span>?
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>If there's nothing to <span class="green">learn</span>...</h1>
			<p>... it't not an <span class="red">alert</span></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1><span class="green">Accept</span> failure</h1>
